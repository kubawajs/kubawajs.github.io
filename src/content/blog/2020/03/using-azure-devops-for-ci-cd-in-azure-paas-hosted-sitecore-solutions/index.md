Some time ago I had a chance to write an article on the topic of CI/CD for Sitecore Azure-hosted solutions to the brand new WT Tech Blog (former Cognifide Tech Blog). Below you can find a link to the full text.

I also recommend other articles on the subject, such as the one written by [Maciej](https://maciejz.dev/) about the [Blue-Green deployment of Sitecore solutions hosted in Azure PaaS](https://tech.cognifide.com/blog/2020/blue-green-deployment-of-sitecore-solutions-hosted-in-azure-paas/).
